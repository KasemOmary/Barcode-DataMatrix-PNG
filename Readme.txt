This is a test project that I hope to turn into something worthwhile.  I was searching Cpan for a datamatrix that is an image.  Found none.  

What do I do?  Make one.

This is a 2d DataMatrix barcode generator based on Barcode::DataMatrix & GD.  It takes an input, and spits out a barcode. 

Sweet & Simple. 

Very rough, and still in development, but the output looks good.  I'll be testing & perfecting it - and packaging it up into a nice bite-sized package - perfect for all of your barcoding needs.

When I say this thing is very rough - I'm talking bout jagged edges & disgustingly coded a couple-hours in a single night project.

Big thanks go out to: 
- Mark A. Stratman - For the work done on HTML::Barcode::DataMatrix + Barcode::DataMatrix.  The HTML version inspired me to step it up a notch.

- Pete & Paul @ UPS - For kicking my butt & giving me access to some equipment to test my work.  Thanks guys, I appreciate the help and I'll keep up the bad work.

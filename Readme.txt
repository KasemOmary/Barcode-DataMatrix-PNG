I was searching Cpan for a datamatrix that is an image.  Found none.

What do I do?  Make one.

This is a 2d DataMatrix barcode generator based on Barcode::DataMatrix & GD.  It takes an input, and spits out a barcode.

Sweet & Simple.

Got it all spit-shined & good for primetime.  Tested, works nice, looks great & good to go.  Barcode away.  Break out your thermal printer & start printing out awesome 2d bacodes that read "LOL THIS BARCODE SAYS MONKEY" ... and slap em all over the office.

Big thanks go out to:
- Mark A. Stratman - For the work done on HTML::Barcode::DataMatrix + Barcode::DataMatrix.  The HTML version inspired me to step it up a notch.

- Pete & Paul @ UPS - For kicking my butt & giving me access to some equipment to test my work.  Thanks guys, I appreciate the help and I'll keep up the bad work.

- Randall Schwartz - for "yelling" at me on usenet all those years ago.  (YES, *THAT* Randall Schwartz.)
